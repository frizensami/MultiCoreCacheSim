-- General idea: for each processor, execute the new trace if there is one, or continue with current action. Then, propagate the bus events to ALL OTHER PROCESSORS: aka all other processors MUST RESPOND to the bus event before this processors' CYCLE is over. Then, repeat for the rest. Check when more awake whether this makes sense. Therefore, processor 1 always has priority, followed by 2...etc. Deterministic
-- Morning note: this makes sense. It's almost like each processor is running sequentially with a particular priority on each cycle, which could happen in a particularly biased computer.

-- |Runs a single cycle for a single processor. Attempts to feed it a list of traces.
